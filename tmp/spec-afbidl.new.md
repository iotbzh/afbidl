# API specification for AGL

## Abstract
This document is a proposal of a formalism that allows to specify, define
and document AGL bindings APIs.
We first define our needs, search for a candidate in the existing FOSS
pool, and eventually set up a custom solution (based on existing and
validated pieces of Free Software).


## About API specification

API Specification is here a broad term that can be understood as : Definition,
Specification, or Documentation.
They are are all related, but also different entities, with their respective
purposes.
In some context, Specification will done in a human natural languge,
with focus on high-level aspects, behaviour and responsabilities...

Definition is a more fine-grained level, often describing the messages
exchanged by the API, using a more machine-oriented formalism that allows
automotized processing.

Documentation is aimed at developpers, API users. It will often compiles
information found in the former, synthetized in a convinient way, for instance
as a set of HTML pages, with hyperlinks, that can be conviniently consulted in
a web browser.

As for now, we will use the word specification in its board meaning, unless
excplicitly stated.


## Requirements for AGL

First off: is API spefication useful for AGL ?

The answer is a loud **YES !**

Indeed, the micro service architecture of AGL and its flexible IPC mechanism
emphasis the decomposition of services or applications in tiny cooperative
parts. This has big advantages in terms of flexibility and development process,
but, subsequently, implies to correctly document interfaces.

In our opinion, we should avoid specifiying using natural human language as
much as possible. We should favor the use of a machine-oriented formalism to
describe most of the aspects of an API.

### Task automation

Doing so enables automation of varioyus tasks such as :

- Generation of documentation (in many formats and using customizable styles)

- Generation of code (either minimal or elaborate)

- Adaptation to transport backend or protocol

- Generation of test cases

- Integration of advanced tools like supervision, tracing, spying

- Proof of system properties, in particular when assembling many API together


### Expected features

The formalism SHALL, at least allows to fullfit the following features:

- Describing JSON data of APIs
- Specifying APIs that throw events (expected, or spurious)
- Describing the permission based security model
- Being Suitable for generation of:
  - Documentation
  - Code skeleton with/without parameter validation
  - Automated test


## Evaluation of existing tools

### OpenAPI

Micro service architectures on web mostly use OpenAPI for specifying and
documenting their API (Application Programming Interface). That made of it, a
good candidate to evaluate.

Sadly, however, the API description language OpenAPI never provided some of the
features required/expected by AGL for a such tool. It mainly lacks features to
describe eventing aspects, the security model is also out-of-scope.

ToBeDone : Possible Extensions  ?

ToBeRewritten: Using OpenAPI also had the disadvantage of implying
some twist of the model and then some ugliness
verbosity.

OpenAPI is not a language, unlike many IDL, but rather consist of structured
data, in JSON format ([1][json-org], [2][json-rfc]).


### Others
ToBeRewritten:
Many IDL (Interface Description Language) exist
but it rarely fit all that requirements.\

First of all, they generally are "languages",
meaning that they are difficult to parse, to
generate and to manipulate by tools.

ToBeDone : what has been evaluated ?


## Proposal of a new formalism

As a side note, that proposal includes advanced designs introduced after
discussions with JoÃ«l Champeau and Philippe Dhaussy, researchers at ENSTA
Bretagne (National Institute of Advanced Technologies of Brittany) specialized
in system modeling and formal verification.

### Fundation of the new formalism

OpenAPI is not a language, unlike many IDL, but rather consist of structured
data, which is much simplier to deal with. There is no need to write down
a generative grammar, a lexer, and other tedious to write compiler parts.

OpenAPI It is a specification made by a data structure of JSON format
[1][json-org], [2][json-rfc].\
Using JSON has the advantage that no parser hasto be written because a standard
one exists.\

Binding verbs payload is also formatted in JSON. An obvious choice to specify
them is then JSON Schema [3][json-schema].\
This allows to describe complex values and their constraints using a format easy
to integrate in tools.


### Toward even more human-friendliness

JSON is a bit more human-friendly than its predecessors like XML, but can still
be a bit tedious to deal with. Another format like YAML [4][yaml] are more easy
to deal with. As stated previously, we'll rely, internally, on JSON and
JSON-Schemas, but it worth that their is a quasi-isomorphism between their data
models.


Comments are an exception, as strict JSON forbids them, whereas YAML welcomes
them quite happily. If a user write down comments in their YAML "source"
specification file and their lost while transpiling it JSON to work with
internally, that's really not a showstopper.

We still to define a technical solution to report an error at the very line that
caused it IN THE SOURCE file. Something like a "reverse lookup table", indexing
source YAML line number, for each line in the transpiled JSON.

NOTE : It may happend that some line in the JSON don't have an equivalent, for
instance, a closing curly brace that closes an object will have equivalent line
in the YAML source. This is not problem because that type of line should NOT be
source of any error - given the YAML is syntaxically valid, and the transpiler
works OK.

There are example of such YAML (and other) to JSON and vice-versa transpilers
like [5][any-json].
